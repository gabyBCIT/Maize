# Maize
A simple maze game where you are corn, and your goal is butter.

Game created with Unity. All assets created with MagicaVoxel, character control and triggers done with C#.

Done:
- Character control
- Collision detection on corn and maze walls
- Triggers on butter
- Created assets using MagicaVoxel

Improvements:
- Could use a restart button
- Would like to host with WebGL
- Would like to add animation to popcorn and corn
- Atmosphere; add trees and other objects around the maze

Dreams:
- Multiple levels (goals of salt, pot, fire)
- Procedurally generated maps
